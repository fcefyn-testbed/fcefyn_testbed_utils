# Contributing a new lab

Two contribution paths share the same SSH gateway VM and upstream Ansible per-lab coordinator setup, but differ in what the lab must support and which runners execute CI. This page summarizes both so a new contributor picks the minimum setup for the target workflow.

---

## 1. Shared foundation

Every contributed lab uses:

- A local [labgrid-coordinator](openwrt-tests-onboarding.md#1-per-lab-coordinator-ssh-gateway) on each lab host (loopback :20408), deployed by the upstream Ansible playbook. The SSH gateway VM (`global-coordinator` hostname) provides SSH jump access for CI runners and developers.
- A **WireGuard** tunnel between the lab host and the SSH gateway VM (for SSH transport).
- A **single inventory** in [openwrt-tests `labnet.yaml`](https://github.com/aparcar/openwrt-tests/blob/main/labnet.yaml) listing labs, devices, maintainers, and access lists (SSH keys are fetched from GitHub at deploy time).
- The [openwrt-tests `playbook_labgrid.yml`](https://github.com/aparcar/openwrt-tests/blob/main/ansible/playbook_labgrid.yml) applied to the lab host: user `labgrid-dev`, gateway SSH key in `authorized_keys`, `labgrid-coordinator`, `labgrid-exporter`, `labgrid-switch-abstraction` via pipx, TFTP, PDUDaemon, netplan, dnsmasq.

The infrastructure is the same; what changes between paths is **which CI runner** executes tests and **which suite** expects which resources.

## 2. Scenario A: base openwrt-tests lab

Goal: contribute DUTs so upstream [aparcar/openwrt-tests](https://github.com/aparcar/openwrt-tests) CI can flash OpenWrt and run vanilla healthchecks on them. Single-node tests. Managed switch and VLAN switching are **optional**: if the lab has no managed switch, everything still works on a static topology.

**Audience:** lab owners who want upstream openwrt-tests coverage on their hardware.

**Runners:** GitHub-hosted runners (`ubuntu-latest`) that reach the lab via the SSH gateway VM. No self-hosted runner required.

**Steps:**

1. Follow [openwrt-tests onboarding](openwrt-tests-onboarding.md): WireGuard, GitHub usernames in `access:`, PR against `aparcar/openwrt-tests` with `labnet.yaml` entry, `ansible/files/exporter/<lab>/*`, lab doc.
2. Apply `playbook_labgrid.yml` on the lab host (gateway SSH key, coordinator, exporter, TFTP, PDUDaemon, dnsmasq, netplan). The playbook now also installs `labgrid-switch-abstraction` via pipx; labs without a managed switch can ignore the CLI.
3. Optional: if the lab has a managed switch and wants dynamic VLAN switching in upstream tests, configure `switch.conf` and `dut-config.yaml` on the host and opt in per test run with `VLAN_SWITCH_ENABLED=1` + `LG_MULTI_PLACES`. See [switch-abstraction.md on the PR branch](https://github.com/aparcar/openwrt-tests/blob/main/docs/switch-abstraction.md) once PR [#218](https://github.com/aparcar/openwrt-tests/pull/218) is merged.

Nothing else is required on the lab side. Upstream CI will start scheduling jobs when `labnet.yaml` lists the lab.

## 3. Scenario B: libremesh-capable lab

Goal: run the [libremesh-tests](https://github.com/libremesh/libremesh-tests) suite (single-node LibreMesh, multi-node mesh, virtual mesh) against DUTs in the lab. Requires a managed switch that can move DUT ports between isolated VLANs and the mesh VLAN (200 by default).

**Audience:** labs that want their DUTs covered by LibreMesh test matrices.

**Runners:** a **self-hosted GitHub runner** under the lab's control (not the aparcar runners). The FCEFyN lab uses `testbed-fcefyn`; other labs should register their own runner so tests run physically close to the DUTs.

**Steps:**

1. Complete Scenario A (same upstream onboarding; the inventory, exporter, per-lab coordinator, `playbook_labgrid.yml` are shared).
2. Managed switch **must be configured**. On the lab host:
   - Credentials in `/etc/switch.conf` (system-wide, group-readable so any SSH user can run `switch-vlan`; see [switch-config.md#multi-user-setup](../configuracion/switch-config.md#multi-user-setup-recommended-for-labs-with-remote-devs)).
   - DUT-to-port map in `/etc/testbed/dut-config.yaml` (or set `SWITCH_DUT_CONFIG`). DUT names in that file must match the suffix of labgrid place names (see place-to-DUT mapping below).
   - Confirm `switch-vlan --help` works as the SSH user.
3. Register a **self-hosted GitHub Actions runner** on the lab host (or on another machine with lab access) and label it for the lime-packages CI workflow. The runner should expose the labels `[self-hosted, testbed-fcefyn]` (or your lab equivalent) — these match the `runs-on:` of `libremesh/lime-packages/.github/workflows/build-firmware.yml`. See [CI runner config](../configuracion/ci-runner.md) for details.
4. The active CI orchestrator is [`build-firmware.yml`](https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-firmware.yml). Each lab declares its hardware in [`targets.yml`](https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/blob/master/.github/ci/targets.yml) (per-target `test_places:` / `test_firmware:` / `image_format:` keys). The legacy `libremesh-tests` daily/pull_requests workflows were retired in May 2026; only the lint workflow `formal.yml` remains in that repo.
5. Local development against the lab: `LG_PROXY=labgrid-<lab>`, `LG_MESH_PLACES=labgrid-<lab>-<dut1>,labgrid-<lab>-<dut2>`, `PLACE_PREFIX=labgrid-<lab>-` (or leave empty for the second-hyphen fallback). See [libremesh-tests CONTRIBUTING_LAB.md](https://github.com/libremesh/libremesh-tests/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING_LAB.md).

### Place-to-DUT mapping

Both suites derive DUT names from labgrid place names by stripping a prefix. Defaults differ:

| Suite | Default | Override |
|-------|---------|----------|
| openwrt-tests (PR #218) | up to the second hyphen | `PLACE_PREFIX` |
| libremesh-tests | `labgrid-fcefyn-` | `PLACE_PREFIX` |

Set `PLACE_PREFIX=labgrid-mylab-` when contributing a lab named `mylab`; `PLACE_PREFIX=""` disables the default and reverts to the second-hyphen strip.

## 4. Decision matrix

| Requirement | Scenario A | Scenario B |
|---|---|---|
| WireGuard tunnel to SSH gateway VM | required | required |
| `labnet.yaml` entry in openwrt-tests | required | required |
| `playbook_labgrid.yml` applied | required | required |
| Self-hosted GitHub runner | **not needed** | **required** |
| Managed switch | optional | **required** |
| `switch.conf` and `dut-config.yaml` on lab host | optional | **required** |
| Target YAML in libremesh-tests | no | per board that runs LibreMesh |
| Test suite | openwrt-tests | libremesh-tests (+ optional openwrt-tests) |

A lab can contribute to both paths at once: the infrastructure is shared. Scenario A is a prerequisite for Scenario B.
