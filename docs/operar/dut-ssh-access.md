# SSH access to DUTs

How `ssh dut-X` reaches each DUT through its isolated VLAN, and how to connect manually when a DUT is on mesh VLAN 200.

---

## Static ProxyCommand

Each DUT SSH alias in `~/.ssh/config` uses `labgrid-dut-proxy`, which queries the switch PVID then `exec`s `labgrid-bound-connect` on `vlan<PVID>`. Template: `configs/templates/ssh_config_fcefyn`.

```
Host dut-belkin-1
    User root
    ProxyCommand sudo labgrid-dut-proxy belkin-1 192.168.1.1 22
```

`labgrid-bound-connect` uses `socat` with `SO_BINDTODEVICE`. Isolated DUTs all use `192.168.1.1`; the interface is what distinguishes them. The proxy must not block on `/tmp/switch.lock`: [Switch SSH lock](../configuracion/switch-config.md#switch-lock).

## VLAN lifecycle during tests

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Test as pytest
    participant Switch as TP-Link switch
    participant DUT as DUT

    Note over DUT: Default: isolated VLAN (100-108)
    Test->>Switch: set_port_vlan(dut, 200)
    Note over DUT: Mesh VLAN 200
    Test->>DUT: run tests via SSHProxy(vlan200)
    Test->>Switch: restore_port_vlan(dut)
    Note over DUT: Back to isolated VLAN
```

- **openwrt-tests**: VLANs never change. DUTs always on isolated VLANs.
- **libremesh-tests**: `conftest_vlan.py` moves ports to VLAN 200 at test start and restores on teardown. A **cancelled** CI job skips teardown; run `switch-vlan --restore-all` on the host.
- **Tests use their own SSH path** (`SSHProxy` with hardcoded `vlan200`), not the `~/.ssh/config` aliases.
- **SSH transport retry**: `SSHProxy` automatically retries up to 3 times on exit code 255 (TCP/SSH transport errors). These are common during batman-adv/babeld convergence right after boot.
- **IP watchdog**: After boot, a background script on each DUT re-applies the fixed mesh SSH IP every 3 seconds for 300 seconds, targeting `br-lan` when UP. This survives network restarts triggered by OpenWrt init scripts or batman-adv configuration.

## VLAN switching: local vs remote

**Only the lab host owns the switch credentials** (SNMP access, `switch-vlan` CLI, `dut-config.yaml`). The developer machine does not.

`conftest_vlan.py` handles both scenarios transparently:

| Execution | `LG_PROXY` | How `switch-vlan` runs |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| From lab host (CI, local dev) | Not set | `subprocess.run(["switch-vlan", "dut", "200"])` |
| From remote developer machine | `labgrid-fcefyn` | `subprocess.run(["ssh", "labgrid-fcefyn", "switch-vlan dut 200"])` |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Remote["Developer machine"]
        pytest["pytest"]
    end
    subgraph Host["Lab host"]
        switch_vlan["switch-vlan"]
        switch["TP-Link switch<br/>(SNMP)"]
    end
    pytest -->|"ssh labgrid-fcefyn<br/>switch-vlan dut 200"| switch_vlan
    switch_vlan -->|SNMP| switch
```

**Result**: Developers do not need to install `switch-vlan`, configure switch credentials, or have `dut-config.yaml` locally. VLAN operations are delegated to the host via SSH.

## Manual access to mesh VLAN 200

If a test crashes before VLAN teardown, a DUT may be stuck on VLAN 200. From the **lab host** (where `vlan200` and `sudo NOPASSWD` for `labgrid-bound-connect` exist):

```bash
sudo labgrid-bound-connect vlan200 <mesh_ssh_ip> 22
```

There are three addresses worth distinguishing during mesh tests:

- `192.168.1.1`: the default OpenWrt LAN IP. This is what isolated single-node access uses through `vlan100`-`vlan108`.
- `10.13.200.x`: the per-DUT mesh SSH/control IP. It is a stable secondary address added on `br-lan` so the host can reach each DUT uniquely while multiple nodes share VLAN 200.
- `10.13.x.x` excluding `10.13.200.x`: the real LibreMesh address on `br-lan`. This is the address mesh assertions should use for ping, ARP, and routing checks.

### Remote developer (LG_PROXY) {: #remote-developer-lg_proxy }

From a developer machine, the `vlan200` interface lives on the lab host, not on the developer machine. The bound-connect must therefore run **on the host** via SSH. The test suite handles this automatically (see `SSHProxy._build_ssh_cmd` in `conftest_mesh.py`); for manual SSH from a machine:

```bash
ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh ${LG_PROXY:-labgrid-fcefyn} sudo /usr/local/sbin/labgrid-bound-connect vlan200 <mesh_ssh_ip> 22" \
    root@<mesh_ssh_ip>
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Machine as Dev machine
    participant Host as Lab host (LG_PROXY)
    participant DUT as DUT mesh (10.13.200.x)
    Machine->>Host: ssh (LG_PROXY)
    Host->>Host: sudo labgrid-bound-connect vlan200 IP 22
    Host->>DUT: TCP socket bound to vlan200
    Machine->>DUT: SSH session through nested ProxyCommand
```

Pre-requisites on the host (already in place for `labgrid-dev` per [host-config 3.4](../configuracion/host-config.md#34-sudoers)): SSH user must have `sudo NOPASSWD` for `/usr/local/sbin/labgrid-bound-connect`. No local `dut-config.yaml` nor `labgrid-switch-abstraction` install is required on the developer machine.

To restore all ports to isolated VLANs after a crash:

```bash
switch-vlan --restore-all
```
