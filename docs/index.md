# FCEFyN HIL testbed documentation

This documentation describes the [fcefyn_testbed_utils](https://github.com/ccasanueva7/fcefyn_testbed_utils) repository, where components of the **hardware-in-the-loop testbed** for [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) and [LibreMesh](https://libremesh.org/) at the [Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales](https://fcefyn.unc.edu.ar/), [Universidad Nacional de Córdoba](https://www.unc.edu.ar/), are centralized.

The documentation covers:

* Lab operation
* Design and infrastructure
* Hardware and software components and their configurations
* Network topology
* Integrations with the test suites and test infrastructure of [openwrt-tests](https://github.com/aparcar/openwrt-tests) and its fork [libremesh-tests](https://github.com/francoriba/libremesh-tests)
* [Video demos](demos.md) of the lab (embedded YouTube)

## Before you start

**Testbed goal** and scope, in brief:

- **Validate firmware** for *OpenWrt*- and *LibreMesh*-based routers in an **automated, repeatable** way using the [Labgrid](https://labgrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) + [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) ecosystem, following *openwrt-tests* and *libremesh-tests*.
- **Cover physical and emulated targets**: tests on **physical devices** in a rack over physical links and on [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) instances with WiFi simulated via [vwifi](https://github.com/sysprog21/vwifi).
- **Operate a shared lab**: with a [unified pool architecture](diseno/unified-pool.md) of devices for both projects, and remote access for administrators.

### Testbed overview

Relationship between orchestration host, switch, gateway, DUTs, power, and serial access:

The design builds on the **remote lab** model from [openwrt-tests](https://github.com/aparcar/openwrt-tests), but scope is not limited to **adding devices** to that network. It also **reuses and extends** the approach with **local infrastructure**, along the same axes (orchestration, network, power, serial) with a focus on **LibreMesh** testing.

The diagram above summarizes the topology: host, switch, gateway, and rack.
